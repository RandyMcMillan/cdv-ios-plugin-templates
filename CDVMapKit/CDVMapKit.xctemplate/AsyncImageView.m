// This class demonstrates how the URL loading system can be used to make a UIView subclass
// that can download and display an image asynchronously so that the app doesn't block or freeze
// while the image is downloading. It works fine in a UITableView or other cases where there
// are multiple images being downloaded and displayed all at the same time.
